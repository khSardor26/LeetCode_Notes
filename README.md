## 📘 LeetCode Notes & Algorithm Journey

This repository documents my personal journey through **LeetCode** while preparing for **technical interviews** and strengthening my **algorithmic thinking**.

The goal of this repo is not just to store solutions, but to:
- Understand **why** an algorithm works
- Capture reusable **patterns and techniques**
- Write **clean, interview-ready explanations**
- Build long-term problem-solving intuition

### 🚀 What you'll find here
- 📌 Common algorithm patterns (two pointers, hashing, binary search, greedy, etc.)
- 🧠 Concept-focused notes (HashMap iteration, cyclic arrays, key-value patterns)
- 💻 Java-based implementations aligned with FAANG-style expectations
- ✍️ Clear explanations instead of brute-force code dumps

### 🛠 Tech & Focus
- Language: **Java**
- Topics: Arrays, Strings, HashMaps, Recursion, Math, Optimization
- Style: Interview-oriented, clean, and readable

### 📈 Purpose
This repository reflects continuous learning and improvement rather than perfection.  
Each commit represents progress, refinement, and deeper understanding.
